# black_jack_game
a black_jack game  in python 

This is a simple implementation of the Blackjack game using Python. The game logic is implemented using classes such as Card, Deck, Hand, and Chips.

The game starts by prompting the player to place a bet. Then, the player and the dealer are dealt two cards each, with one of the dealer's cards hidden. The player can then choose to hit or stand. If the player's hand value exceeds 21, they bust and lose their bet. If the player chooses to stand, the dealer reveals their hidden card and hits until their hand value reaches 17 or higher. If the dealer's hand value exceeds 21, they bust and the player wins. If the dealer's hand value is higher than the player's hand value, the player loses their bet. If the player's hand value is higher than the dealer's hand value, the player wins. If both the player and the dealer have the same hand value, it's a push and the player gets their bet back.

The game continues until the player decides to stop playing or runs out of chips.

To start the program, simply run the Python file containing the code in a Python interpreter or IDE like PyCharm, VSCode, or Jupyter Notebook. Once the program is running, follow the prompts to play the game.

Enjoy the game!
